We are going to have to have tooling conversations, and an explanation of Integtrated Development Environment is something that we'll have to have too; but for now the folks over at Microsoft have provide a very slick, very small piece of tooling that will run _everywhere_.  So we don't have to spend days working out the issues of whether your particular machine has everything it needs.

that you're going to want to do as you move deeper down this rabbit hole.
