# Install GIT

The git documentation has plenty of different methods to install, and you can find those [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

I suggest using a package manager.  If you're on a Windows PC try Chocolatey, on a Mac go with Homebrew

### Mac [Install Instructions](https://brew.sh)
```bash
$ brew install git
```
### Windows [Install Instructions](https://chocolatey.org/packages/git.install)
```powershell
C:\choco install git.install
```

### Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```
OR
```bash
sudo yum install git
```

# Download Visual Studio Code
We are going to have to have tooling conversations, and an explanation of Integtrated Development Environment is something that we'll have to have too; but for now the folks over at Microsoft have provide a very slick, very small piece of tooling that will run _everywhere_.  So we don't have to spend days working out the issues of whether your particular machine has everything it needs.

Interesting enough, VS Code is based on the same web technologies that we're going to try and cover here.

### You can get code [here](code.visualstudio.com).

# Go to github.com
create a profile

# "fork" this repo
This is a little different than the old addage "stick a fork in it", and we'll talk more about GiT
as we move along.  But for now, "forking in github parlance is akin to creating a fork in the road.  When you head over to your profile page (yeah, this is kind of a social network too) you shoud be able 
to see 

# Create your landing page
We're going to add a couple of simple things here, and as we go we'll try and go through the bare minimums of what we're looking at as we go.
## Index.html
A quick word about "Hello World".  Every "start here" example you've seen or lkely will ever see starts with the Console/Std Out/Print Ln statment "Hello World".  We're not doing that.  Instead, because we're headed "down the rabbit hole" we can go two ways _Alice in Wonderland_ proper, or the red pill/blue pill trope.  

Lets go Red Pill, Blue pill.  So do that now on your newly created index.html.  Simply write the two phrases Red Pill, Blue pill on your blank canvas.

Now, if you go over to a file explorer and click/double click/ open your new index.html your machine should automatically open up in your default browser and you should see Red Pill Blue Pill.  There's your first web page.  No you are not on the web; no it doesn't "do" anything, and it doesn't look particularly spectacular. It's a long way to the bottom of this rabbit-hole.

# NOW lets save our work...
VS Code has a really nice tool that lets you visualize your recent changes, and there is probably a really bright blue dot somewhere toards the left.  Go ahead and click on it -- you should see your index.html file, likely with the letter U somewhere close to it.  

Do us (and yourself) a solid though, a open a terminal window.  You can do that by going up to the View Menu and selecting Terminal, but I prefer CTRL + ` (that funny apostrophe in the upper left corneer of your keyboard).

## main.js

## site.css

## Open Google Chrome 
(or Firefox, or Safari) 
but please for the love of everything holy.  Do NOT open Internet Explorer.  Not only is it in a 
state of quasi limbo, but it has lots of compatibility issues with all the newest and coolest stuff
that you're going to want to do as you move deeper down this rabbit hole.
